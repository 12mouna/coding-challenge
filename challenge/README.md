# Taktile Coding Challenge

The challenge is to implement `fold` in the language of my choice and I used Typescript. 

The fold function of the challenge consists of sending as parameter a starting value 0, operator + and a list of values.

I wanted to make it more general so with this function you can work also with string and with any operator you pass.

Also I did a condition to make sure that the type of the initial value and the list are the same because with the type 'any' for exemple  we can have an initial value number and a list of string which is not correct.
